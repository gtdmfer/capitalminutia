    <h2>Current Project, <i>15May2024</i></h2>
    <p>Earn enough to repair my Prius! Turn my urgency into your cost savings and get that project done. </p>
    <p>Well, look at me - here, in quite a pickle. One minute, stretching the last of my savings into a Connecticut spring/summer/spring/winter?/spring. The next, one red dashboard light changes everything.  So now, instead of crafting the perfect re-entry into the freelancing market, I come, cards shown, asking if I can help with any of your projects, tasks or work that is taking you away from more important work, or life. Propose a project, [ <a href="sms:+12039397141">SMS</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/QYVxP8GF">Discord</a> ]</p>


    <p>I think I work best as a steady, eager sidekick - ready to pitch in,  ready to gather/document/grind, ready to contribute to success.  I will gladly share the overhead of outsourcing by including a weekly, free 30 minute strategy meeting for each week we work together.  I am willing to adjust other terms to fit your needs or assure your reservations. [ <a href="sms:+12039397141">SMS</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/QYVxP8GF">Discord</a> ] </p>

    <li><b>Garden Design</b> (Reddit, CL) - most familiar with the natural history and flows of the northeast, but glad to work with someone experienced in their own bioregion in permaculture systems designs.  If you are in the northeast, lets dream up a wildly productive, enticing and life-giving garden for you this year.  Organic, low-maintenance and focused on herbs, periennials and vegetables.

  <h3>Where am I going with all this?</h3>
  <p><i><b>Food Coach</i></b> What you eat does create your baseline health.  Crazy food prices and huge demands on your time make healthy eating impossible without an understanding of nutrition, modern agriculture practices - good and bad, and a set of skills in the kitchen and grocery store.  Instill a routine for healthy eating now and continue to revive your health for your future years.</p>
  <p><i><b>Regenerative Degrowth</i></b> There is no doubt the fundamental philosophy of our economy has to change.  For my part in forging a new way - I am collecting the excesses of Mother Culture and thrifting them at reasonable prices.  Because used things should be cheap and useful things should not be trash.</p>
  <p><i><b>Cohabitation as a New Social Contract</i></b> If the exploitation of the modern economy were to be seen and eridicated, which way could we choose to organize society?  Perhaps by agreeing to the fundamental principle of cohabitation: as beings that share this planet, we run the systems that make it easier for all beings to live safe, fed, and sheltered lives.  Obviously this is in the beginning stages of taking shape, but this is what I hope to build up to, even though this is still in the thought experiment stage right now.. </p>
  <p><i><b>c0untercu1ture</i></b> I know, its a cheesy name.  I started using it along time ago and until another one pops into my head - it's good enough <a href="sms:+12039397141">SMS|suggest a new one here</a>  Ahh, my Maria-in-an-alpine-meadow kinda feeling happens when I imagine a piece of land that is cared for by the people who work, live, create and play on it.  Consolidating buying power, equipment access, individual artisian markets and access to space - the infrastructure and governance to share those things and all benefit, in fact - the real goal is to create 'win-win-win' scenarios for individuals, society and earth. [<a href="sms:+12039397141">SMS|Tell me I'm silly here, but tell me why so I can evolve!</a>]</p>
